## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Verify AWS CLI installation
aws --version

# Configure AWS CLI (if not already done)
aws configure

# Create test files
echo "Version 1 content" > test1.txt
echo "Version 2 content" > test2.txt
echo "Version 3 content" > test3.txt
```

### Step 2: Execute Labs in Sequence
1. **Lab 1**: Storage Classes & Lifecycle Policies
2. **Lab 2**: Versioning & MFA Delete  
3. **Lab 3**: Cross-Region Replication

### Step 3: Document and Submit
- Capture screenshots at each milestone
- Complete assessment questions
- Submit deliverables using naming convention

## üí∞ Cost Optimization Insights

### Storage Class Pricing Comparison (per GB/month)
| Storage Class | Cost | Use Case |
|---------------|------|----------|
| Standard | $0.023 | Frequently accessed data |
| Standard-IA | $0.0125 + retrieval | Infrequently accessed data |
| Intelligent-Tiering | $0.023 + monitoring | Unknown access patterns |
| Glacier Flexible | $0.004 | Archive with flexible retrieval |
| Glacier Deep Archive | $0.00099 | Long-term archive |

### Lifecycle Policy Best Practices
- Transition to Standard-IA after 30 days minimum
- Use Intelligent-Tiering for unpredictable access patterns
- Archive to Glacier for compliance and backup requirements
- Set expiration policies for temporary data

## üîí Security & Compliance Features

### Versioning Benefits
- **Data Protection**: Prevents accidental deletion/modification
- **Compliance**: Maintains audit trail of changes
- **Recovery**: Point-in-time restoration capabilities

### MFA Delete Requirements
- Root user access only
- Hardware or virtual MFA device
- CLI-based configuration
- Enhanced security for critical operations

### Cross-Region Replication Use Cases
- **Disaster Recovery**: Geographic redundancy
- **Compliance**: Data residency requirements
- **Performance**: Reduced latency for global users
- **Analytics**: Cross-region data processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Lab 1: Lifecycle Policies
**Issue**: "Lifecycle rule invalid"  
**Solution**: Verify minimum duration requirements (30 days for IA transitions)

#### Lab 2: Versioning
**Issue**: "Cannot enable versioning"  
**Solution**: Check bucket permissions and IAM policies

#### Lab 3: Cross-Region Replication
**Issue**: "Replication configuration invalid"  
**Solution**: Ensure versioning enabled on both source and destination buckets

**Issue**: "Access denied for replication role"  
**Solution**: Verify IAM role has proper S3 permissions

### Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Remove all object versions (use with caution)
aws s3api delete-objects --bucket [BUCKET-NAME] \
  --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket [BUCKET-NAME] \
  --query='{Objects: Versions[].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId}}')"

# Force delete bucket
aws s3 rb s3://[BUCKET-NAME] --force
```

## üìä Assessment Questions

### Lab 1: Storage Classes & Lifecycle
1. What happens to cost when transitioning from Standard to Standard-IA?
2. Can you transition directly from Standard to Glacier Deep Archive?
3. What's the minimum duration for Standard-IA storage?

### Lab 2: Versioning & MFA Delete
1. What happens to previous versions when uploading new versions?
2. How do you permanently delete a specific object version?
3. Why can only root users enable MFA Delete?

### Lab 3: Cross-Region Replication
1. What are the prerequisites for CRR setup?
2. Do delete markers replicate by default?
3. Can you replicate within the same region?

## üìù Submission Requirements

### Required Deliverables
